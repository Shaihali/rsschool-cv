## About Me 
Purposeful, energetic, self-developing programmer of the 21st century.
I write code with burning eyes and with great desire.
I like to solve difficult problems and after a long and dreary process, to enjoy the solution found.
Opening up after 3 months of work and communication.
I have a goal to develop and become a professional in development.
During my becoming a front-line soldier, quite a few projects were made based on layouts from Figma,
with and without adaptive, with the connection of scripts and frameworks.
I really want to find a good team to their liking and write code for the soul together, so that customers go right into the soul.
